        //when you declare a variable using var this is function scoped.
        //which means the variable can be accessed anywhere if its inside a function.

        //with var you can assign a value and use it again and again. 
        //And there is a chance they can be overwritten as they can be accessed anywhere.

        //Let will save us from overwriting a variable.

        //We place values that dont want to be changed into a Const Variable.
